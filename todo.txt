- Use other type of IDs for peers(?)

- When closing (or during execution) store last known live peers along with a timestamp (when booting connect to these peers right away if timestamp is within a certain limit)

- Implement epidemic broadcast trees to facilitate routing and maintain live peers ?

- Implement our own pub/sub protocol
